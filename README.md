# Vigenere
Vigenere Cipher implementation in C:

I have to throw this online since other code I found online were inadequate:
1. They didn't take into account special characters
2. Upper and lower case plaintext has different ciphertext
3. Spaces are not kept in ciphertext
4. All the plaintext they choose are already set to upper case with no spaces, that's normally not the case in real life application.
5. All of the codes I've seen on has a lot of abundant parts, so I tried shorten them down as much as I can.
