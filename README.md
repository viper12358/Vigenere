# Vigenere
Vigenere Cipher implementation in C:

I have to throw this online since other code I found online were a bit inadequate:

1. They didn't take into account edge cases
2. Upper and lower case plaintext has different ciphertext (generally not what you want)
3. Spaces are not kept in ciphertext
4. All the plaintext they choose are already set to upper case with no spaces and without special characters, that's normally not the case in real life application.
5. All of the codes I've seen on have a lot of abundant parts, so I tried shorten them down as much as I can.
